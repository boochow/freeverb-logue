# Freeverb reverberator for logue SDK
This is a [logue SDK](https://korginc.github.io/logue-sdk/) port of Freeverb reverberator by Jezar at Dreampoint. See readme.txt for the original readme. The original source code of Freeverb can be found on [this site](http://freeverb3vst.osdn.jp/freeverbsource.zip).

Cureently works correctly on NTS-1 and minilogue xd. (On prologue you need to decrease 8 comb filters to 6. Probably because prologue's CPU for reverb is less powerful.)

The binary is available on [this page](https://github.com/boochow/freeverb-logue/releases).
