# Freeverb reverberator for logue SDK
This is a [logue SDK](https://korginc.github.io/logue-sdk/) port of (Freeverb)[http://freeverb3vst.osdn.jp/freeverbsource.zip] reverbrator by Jezar at Dreampoint. See readme.txt for the original readme.
Cureently works correctly on NTS-1 only. (Probably because NTS-1's CPU is more powerful than prologue/minilogue-xd.)
The binary is available on [this page](https://github.com/boochow/freeverb-logue/releases).
